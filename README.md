# linked_lists
This repository was created to study about linked lists before finish bonus of libft project, to understand better about.

PS: I'll build this readme later, but have some important informations that you need to know before read these codes.

1. For a while, all my trainning is based in this playlist: [CodeVault](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqABt5AS4FmXeWuuNDS3XGENJO1VYGxl)
2. I'll not use better practices of coding. (I mean that when I comment some code, I do it in bad places, like inside of a function or something like that.)
3. Test code to improve your skills.
